# What I have learned

The fundamentals of Vanilla JavaScript, the use of Intl object - the ECMAScript Internationalization API for language sensitive string comparison, number formatting, and date and time formatting. A lot of methods for itteration through objects and arrays. As well manipulation the DOM with CSS and setTimeout function.

# What issues have I faced and how I resolved them

The most challenging was the part where I needed to chain multiple methods in a function. But with help of the MDN, W3Schools and the tutorial's hint, I resolved them.
